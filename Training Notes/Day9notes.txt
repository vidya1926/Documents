Classroom:1
===========
Classroom:
1. Implement to get data from feature file
2. Create One more scenario and move all common steps to Background
3. Implement one of the scenario with Scenario Outline and Examples


Classroom practice:2
========================
Create a separate Feature file for all the 5 testcases of leaftaps and implement it
Implement Scenario Outline  (Wherever Applicable)
Implement the preconditions and postconditions using Hooks Implementation and extend baseclass for all 5 testcases

Classroom practice:3
======================
1. Remove Hooks and move your precondition and postconditio to your baseclass
2. Extend BAseClass in Runner and AbstractTestNGCucumberTests in Baseclass
3. Apply @Functional to 1st Scenario, @Smoke to 2nd Scenrario, @Rungressio and @Smoke to 3rd Scenario
    Execute Smoke and Regression scenarios
